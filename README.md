# mathematica-clojure-analysis

Unimaginatively named suite of tools for analyzing Clojure (at the moment) source code using Mathematica's lovely graph theoretical and visualization support.

## Status

For the moment this library refers to a fork of [ClojureLink](https://github.com/kovasb/ClojureLink) I haven't bothered to put on GitHub yet or test against anyone else's machine. If any of the world's three or four users of both Clojure and Mathematica want to use this library for their own work, I'd be happy to take a weekend to make this package usable by non-Tims persons. In the meantime, here are some screenshots of all the fun I'm having.
